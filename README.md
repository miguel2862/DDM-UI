## üåü About

The Diffuse Discrepancy Model (DDM) Simulator is an innovative, open-source tool designed for researchers in behavioral sciences. Based on the seminal work of Donahoe, Burgos and Palmer (1993), it provides a connectionist interpretation of the unified principle of reinforcement for both operant and Pavlovian conditioning.

## üöÄ Key Features

- üß† Simulates Pavlovian and operant conditioning
- üî¨ Grounded in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology principles
- üí° Models neural processing units (NPUs) using advanced activation and learning rules
- üîÑ Incorporates hippocampal and dopaminergic systems for comprehensive learning simulations

## üíª Installation

1. Download the installer:
   - [English Version (v0.05)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_g1aYD9k8oR31n-Mi2L1dPRHYOjSSriN/view?usp=sharing)
   - [Spanish Version (v0.04)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gy456KA_bwoXmhocAvuYWLrurgJ-OUnx/view?usp=sharing)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. The installer will create a folder containing:
   - R portable
   - DDM.R file
   - Other necessary components

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 500 MB free disk space

## üèÅ Quick Start

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your simulation.

## üìö Documentation

The DDM Simulator comes with comprehensive documentation to help you get started and make the most of its features:

### User Interface Overview

The simulator's interface is divided into several key sections:

1. **Home**: Provides an introduction to the DDM and its capabilities.
2. **Network Architecture**: Allows you to define and visualize the neural network structure.
3. **Create Trials**: Design experimental trials with specific stimuli and timings.
4. **Configure Contingencies**: Set up the experimental conditions and phases.
5. **Simulate**: Run your designed experiments and observe the results.
6. **Individual Results**: Analyze the outcomes for individual simulations.
7. **General Results**: View aggregated results across multiple simulations.

### Help Section

Within the simulator, you can access the "Help" section, which offers:

- Detailed explanations of each component and parameter
- Step-by-step guides for common tasks
- Theoretical background on the Diffuse Discrepancy Model
- Troubleshooting tips and FAQs

### Example Simulation

To get started with a pre-configured simulation:

1. Navigate to the 'Simulate' section in the interface.
2. In the 'Simulation File Name' field, enter: `Extinction_example`
3. For the 'Simulation Directory Path', use: `Simulation example/Extinction_example.rds`
4. Click 'Load Simulation' to begin.

## üõ†Ô∏è Open Science & Development

We embrace the principles of open science. The DDM Simulator is designed to be modified, extended, and improved by the scientific community:

- Explore and modify the R code: [DDM_UI.R](R/DDM_UI.R)
- Add new functions, graphics, or analysis tools
- Customize the user interface
- Implement new file formats or data structures

We encourage researchers to fork the repository, make improvements, and share their work with the community. Together, we can advance the field of behavioral science through collaborative development and open sharing of knowledge.

The original SelNet code, written in Pascal, is also available at [https://github.com/jeburgos-selnet/source-code](https://github.com/jeburgos-selnet/source-code)
