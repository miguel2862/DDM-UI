## 🌟 About

The Diffuse Discrepancy Model (DDM) Simulator is an innovative, open-source tool designed for researchers in behavioral sciences. Based on the seminal work of Donahoe, Burgos and Palmer (1993), it provides a connectionist interpretation of the unified principle of reinforcement for both operant and Pavlovian conditioning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 Simulates Pavlovian and operant conditioning
- 🔬 Grounded in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology principles
- 💡 Models neural processing units (NPUs) using advanced activation and learning rules
- 🔄 Incorporates hippocampal and dopaminergic systems for comprehensive learning simulations

## 💻 Installation

1. Download the installer:
   - [English Version (v0.05)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_g1aYD9k8oR31n-Mi2L1dPRHYOjSSriN/view?usp=sharing)
   - [Spanish Version (v0.04)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gy456KA_bwoXmhocAvuYWLrurgJ-OUnx/view?usp=sharing)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. The installer will create a folder containing:
   - R portable
   - DDM.R file
   - Other necessary components

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 500 MB free disk space

## 🏁 Quick Start

1. Navigate to the installed directory.
2. Run the DDM Simulator shortcut or execute DDM.R using the provided R portable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your simulation.

## 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive user manuals are included within the simulator. Access them through the application's help menu for detailed instructions and in-depth information.

## 🧪 Example Simulation

To get started with a pre-configured simulation:

1. Navigate to the 'Simulate' section in the interface.
2. In the 'Simulation File Name' field, enter: `Extinction_example`
3. For the 'Simulation Directory Path', use: `Simulation example/Extinction_example.rds`
4. Click 'Load Simulation' to begin.

Example file: [Extinction_example.rds](Simulation%20example/Extinction_example.rds)

## 🛠️ Open Science & Development

We embrace the principles of open science. The DDM Simulator is designed to be modified, extended, and improved by the scientific community:

- Explore and modify the R code: [DDM_UI.R](R/DDM_UI.R)
- Add new functions, graphics, or analysis tools
- Customize the user interface
- Implement new file formats or data structures

We encourage researchers to fork the repository, make improvements, and share their work with the community. Together, we can advance the field of behavioral science through collaborative development and open sharing of knowledge.
