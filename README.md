## About

The Diffuse Discrepancy Model (DDM) Simulator is a powerful tool designed for simulating learning and conditioning phenomena in behavioral sciences. Based on the work of Donahoe, Burgos and Palmer (1993), this simulator offers a connectionist interpretation of the unified principle of reinforcement for operant and Pavlovian conditioning.

## Key Features

- Simulates both Pavlovian and operant conditioning
- Based on principles of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology
- Uses activation and learning rules to model neural processing units (NPUs) behavior
- Incorporates hippocampal and dopaminergic systems in the learning process

## Installation

### Windows Executable

1. Download `DDM_Setup.exe` (358 MB) from the releases page.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. The installer will create a folder containing:
   - R portable
   - DDM.R file
   - Other necessary components

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 500 MB free disk space

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the installed directory.
2. Run the DDM Simulator shortcut or execute DDM.R using the provided R portable.
