## 🌟 About

The Diffuse Discrepancy Model (DDM) Simulator is a cutting-edge tool designed for behavioral scientists and researchers. Based on the groundbreaking work of Donahoe, Burgos and Palmer (1993), it offers a connectionist interpretation of the unified principle of reinforcement for both operant and Pavlovian conditioning.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🧠 Simulates both Pavlovian and operant conditioning
- 🔬 Grounded in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology principles
- 💡 Models neural processing units (NPUs) using advanced activation and learning rules
- 🔄 Incorporates hippocampal and dopaminergic systems for comprehensive learning simulations

## 💻 Installation

### Windows Executable

1. Download `DDM_Setup.exe` (358 MB) from the [releases page](https://github.com/your-repo/DDM-UI/releases).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. The installer will create a folder containing:
   - R portable
   - DDM.R file
   - Other necessary components

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 500 MB free disk space

## 🏁 Quick Start

1. Navigate to the installed directory.
2. Run the DDM Simulator shortcut or execute DDM.R using the provided R portable.

## 🧪 Example Simulation

To get started with a pre-configured simulation:

1. Navigate to the 'Simulate' section in the interface.
2. In the 'Simulation File Name' field, enter: `Extinction_example`
3. For the 'Simulation Directory Path', use: `Simulation example/Extinction_example.rds`
4. Click 'Load Simulation' to begin.

You can find this example in the repository: [Extinction_example.rds](Simulation%20example/Extinction_example.rds)
